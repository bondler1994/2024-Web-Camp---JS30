            // You might think we can just do something like this:

            //  however what happens when we update that array?

            // now here is the problem!

            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
            const team2 = players.slice();

            // one way

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in

            // or use the new ES6 Spread

            // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

            // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

            // with Objects
            const person = {
                name: "Wes Bos",
                age: 80,
            };

            // and think we make a copy:

            // how do we take a copy instead?

            // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

            // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
